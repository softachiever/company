Strategy hub co is an IT consulting company and the first website I'll be building from scratch. As a no-code website designer, I've always used themes,wordPress and drag and drug plugin like elementor for all my client's projects but as I'm learning to code with the odin project, I decided to build this client's website from scratch. I'll be doing this with the help of a friend who's also learning to code but is ahead of me in HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge wise. I hope this turns out as expected. Fingers crossed.
